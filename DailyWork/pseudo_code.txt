As an airport assistant, I want to be able to create passengers with a name and a passport number so that I can add them to a flight
 
class Passenger:
                        name 
                        passport number
          give_name():
                       return name 
          give_passport():
                       return passport number
Test: 
give_name
give_passport
 

As an airport assistant, I want to add passengers to Flight Trips so that I can sell them tickets
 
class FlightTrips:
                 destination  
                 time and date departure 
                 duration 
                 plane
                 price 
                 capacity  
                 people on plane  = []
 
          generate_report(flyers ):
                  dict={​​​​​​​}​​​​​​​
                  for people in people on plane:
                         dict[people ]=passports
                 return dict
 
        check_capacity ( ):
                if(capacity >= plane.max):
                          return False
                   else:      
                           print("You can sell the passenger a ticket")          
                          return True
 
       sell_ticket(passenger  ):
               if(check_capacity( )):
                      people on plane.append(passenger)
               else:
                      print ("Cannot sell ticket plane is full")
       
       change_plane(new_plane):
                plane=new_plane
 
Test: 
test the plane data 
check_capacity() if plane has gone over its max 
change_plane() check if the new plane has been assigned correctly  
generate_report(flyers ) check if the out matches the passengers who are booked for the flight.
